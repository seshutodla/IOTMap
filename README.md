# IOTMap
This is a temporary readme file. 

Client Directory --> DeviceDis.js (takes care of the scanning and verification of devices) and DisplayMap.html (displays the decices in the network)

Server Directory --> only the databaseinsert.txt is of any importance, the rest are sandbox testing files. 

RaspPiScripts --> pyscript.js sends the packets of data from the iot device to the computer.
